# CLT badges
A badge is a digital mark indicating a completion of a learning event that leads to the acquisition of a specific skill, quality, or knowledge. In a nutshell, digital badges are small images that contain validated and sharable information about the learning event completed by the badge owner and the acquired skills or knowledge. The badges offered by the Center for Language and Technology are created using [Mozilla Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/about/).
